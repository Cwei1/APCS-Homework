The map version of each stores values mapped to specific keys. It implements the Map interface. The set version stores only a value, whihc cannot be duplicated. This version implements the Set interface and is backed by the map version.

As for speed, we tested both the adding and accessing speed of the maps, by using the putting and get methods for each. In both cases, Hashmap was decidedly faster, nearly halving the speed of the TreeMap.

Java's version of a heap is a priorityqueue. An unbounded queue is based on a priority heap.
